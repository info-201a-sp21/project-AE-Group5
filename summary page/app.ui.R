  1990 and it decreases to 10-11 million in 2020. Big countries such as 
  China, Mexico and Canada are reducing the deforesation levels but 
  to varying degrees. Some countries like China decreased at lower

  analyze the amount of deforestation in each country and how different 
  countries contribute to the global climate change."),
