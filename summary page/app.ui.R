  general global increasing among years. China and the United States are the two 
    countries increasing fossil fuel combustion spending from 1965 to 2019. 
    Besides, China has three times more spending increase than the United States. 
    Interestingly, United States' fossil fuel combustion spending the highest 
    year in 2000, and it starts to decrease slightly, while China's fossil fuel 
    combustion spending start dramatically increasing after 2000. By discovering
    the data from this page, it helps us gain insight that the burning fossil

  P("This map shows that the map is global earth surface temperature general is 
  generally increasing. Overall, the global temperature increases around 0.5 to 
  1 Celsius in 50 years. Besides, the interactive map shows how the earth's 
  temperature changes in a specific country. For examples,
  the United States average temperature in 1964 was -3.196 Celsius, -2.155 in 2013.
    Russian, average temperature was -24.793 in 1964 and -24.229 in 2013. 
    This page of the map bring us a clear idea of how the earth temperature 
    change in  countries or global, climate change trend is harm to environment,
    and we predict that the fossil fuel combustion spending can be one of the 
    factors that cause surface temperature increase.")
