# Final Project
## Domain of Interest
###### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
**Environmental issues** are becoming more and more severe in the present world. One of the factors that cause the deterioration of the environment is human activities. We want to find out how the humanâ€™s actions impact the environment and what are the potential dangers it brings to the future.

###### Examples of other data driven projects related to this domain
- [the United Nations](https://fra-data.fao.org/)
  - Agenda 15 of the United Nations is about sustainable development, which includes the loss of forest on Earth.
  - This website provides information about forest resource assesment, and people can sort the data by countroes and regions.


###### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain
- **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and forest loss?** Forest is the place that can consume CO2, and one cuase of climate change is increase in CO2 concentration. If the year of climate change becomes severe matches the year that the number of forest decreases, there might be a relationship between them. 


## Finding Data
###### Dataset 1
About Forest Loss
[(website)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-change-forest-area)

*Description of how was the data collected or generated*

This data is collected by Hannah Ritchie, and the data source is from [the UN Food and Agriculture Organization](https://fra-data.fao.org/ ). This data is about the net change of forest area, and it is divided into 5 years period to deal with the volatility of changes.

*How many observations (rows) and features (columns) are in your data*

There are 476 observations and 4 features.

*What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?*

- Which country has the highest net increase in forest area?
- Which country has the highest net decrease in forest area?
- What is the globally average change in forest cover?
