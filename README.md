# Final Project
## Domain of Interest
### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
**Environmental issues** are becoming more and more severe in the present world. One of the factors that cause the deterioration of the environment is human activities. We want to find out how the human’s actions impact the environment and what are the potential dangers it brings to the future.

### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?
- **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and forest loss?** Forest is the place that can consume carbon dioxide (CO2), and one cause of climate change is increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. If the year of climate change becomes severe matches the year that the number of forest decreases, there might be a relationship between them.
- **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and fossil fuel combustion?** This question can be answered by comparing with datasets of climate change and fossil fuel combustion to find out if the used of fossil fuel combustion have influenced on climate change.
- **Whether there is a relationship between the deforestation and fossil fuel combustion?** Fossil fuel combustion as one of the human activities has started to speed up the process of warming at an alarming rate that could lead to an extinction level event. We can use our datasets to find out if the increase in fossil fuel burning affects the rate of deforestation, which eventually leads to climate change.

## Finding Data
### Forest Loss Dataset

- We downloaded the dataset from this [website](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-change-forest-area)

- This data is collected by Hannah Ritchie, and the data source is from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. This data is about the net change of forest area, and it is divided into 5 years period to deal with the volatility of changes.

- There are 476 observations in the data.

- There are 4 features in the data.

- The questions **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and forest loss?** can be answered by this dataset. Furthermore, this dataset can help to explore the forest decreasing rate.

### Fossil Fuel Combustion Dataset

- We downloaded the dataset from this [website](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fossil-fuel-primary-energy)

- This data  was collected by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser, and the data is from BP Statistical Reviews of World Energy. The data is about fossil fuel consumption from country to country, measured in terawatt-hours (TWh).

- There are 195 observations in the data.

- There are 4 features in the data.

- The questions **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and fossil fuel combustion?** can be be answered by this dataset. Additionally, this dataset shows the fossil fuel consumption rate from different countries in the world.

### Global Climate Change Dataset

- We downloaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)

- The selected dataset “ Global Average Land Temperature by Country” was collected by Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This is a long time study of climate change by country, with monthly updates,  covering the period 1743–2013.

- There are 577462 observations in the data.

- There are 4 features in the data.

- The questions **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and forest loss?**  and **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and fossil fuel combustion?** can be answered by this dataset.
