# Final Project
## Domain of Interest
#### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
**Environmental issues** are becoming more and more severe in the present world. One of the factors that cause the deterioration of the environment is human activities. We want to find out how the human’s actions impact the environment and what are the potential dangers it brings to the future.

#### Examples of other data driven projects related to this domain.
- [the United Nations](https://fra-data.fao.org/) Agenda 15 of the United Nations is about sustainable development, which includes the loss of forest on Earth. This website provides information about forest resource assessment, and people can sort the data by countries and regions.
- [Global Temperature Change by NASA]（https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/)shows the change in global land-ocean temperature relative to 1880-2020 average temperatures.


#### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?
- **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and forest loss?** Forest is the place that can consume carbon dioxide (CO2), and one cause of climate change is increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. If the year of climate change becomes severe matches the year that the number of forest decreases, there might be a relationship between them.
- **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and fossil fuel combustion?** This question can be answered by compared with datasets of climate change and fossil fuel combustion and find out if the used of fossil fuel combustion have influence on climate change.

## Finding Data
#### Forest Loss Dataset

- We downloaded the dataset from this [website](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-change-forest-area)

- This data is collected by Hannah Ritchie, and the data source is from [the UN Food and Agriculture Organization](https://fra-data.fao.org/ ). This data is about the net change of forest area, and it is divided into 5 years period to deal with the volatility of changes.

- There are 476 observations in the data.

- There are 4 features in the data.

*(The questions part may need edit)*

- _Which country has the highest net increase in forest area?_
- _Which country has the highest net decrease in forest area?_
- _What is the globally average change in forest cover?_

#### Global Climate Change Dataset
We downloaded the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv)

- The selected dataset “ Global Average Land Temperature by Country” was collected by Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This is a long time study of climate change by country, with monthly updates,  covering the period 1743–2013.

- There are 577462 observations in the data.

- There are 4 features in the data.

- The questions **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and forest loss?**  and **Whether there is a relationship between the climate change and fossil fuel combustion?** can be answered by this dataset.
